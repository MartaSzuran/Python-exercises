# # Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6.
# # formula V = 4/3 PI R^3
# # Exercise 15


# create constant PI
PI = 3.1415926535897931

# radius 6
# I can also write every number with float point like 6.0
r = 6

volume = 4/3 * PI * r**3

print("The volume of sphere with radius 6 is: ", volume)
