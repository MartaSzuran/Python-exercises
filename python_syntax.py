# # Python Docstring:

# A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition.
# Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.

# All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes exported by a module should also have
# docstrings.
# Public methods (including the __init__ constructor) should also have docstrings.
